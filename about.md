### About Me

My name is Victoria, I am a Montreal transplant in Ottawa. I completed my Bachelor's degree in English Literature with Honours at Carleton University. I have continued my academic path at Carleton as a Master's Student in English Literature, with a specialization in Digital Humanities. When my face is not jammed into a book, I work as a teaching assistant. I have volunteered over the years both for the Charlatan newspaper, as well as at the Canadian Cancer Society. Academically, my interests focus on 18th and 19th century literature.
