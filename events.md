### Canada in the Digital World: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly


On November 2nd, I attended Policy Ignite’s event Canada in the Digital World: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. At first, heading to the event, I began to ponder ‘how will this event help me?’ or ‘how will this event be applicable to someone not working in the government?’, and the answers to my questions become increasingly clear as the night progressed; this event solidified exactly how imbedded digital tools are in our society, and more importantly, how the need for digital tools and advancements are only growing. While the main theme of the program revolved around the way that digital tools need to continue to find their way into government to enhance society and efficiency, I began to feel more at ease when I heard words like Github, or Slack, which I now know what they are and, debatably, how they work. Some of the talks covered topics such as Geomapping, creating space within government to share code and tools, how using digital tools could enhance efficiency, and the most applicable to our studies in Digital Humanities, is the need to incorporate the human into the digital. This lecture, was for me, by far the most applicable to our purpose and in fact extremely interesting; it was conducted by a Behaviour Neurologist. She tackled the downsides of the digital in terms of the downsides of the human brain and argued that these downsides are not to be seen as reducing the benefits of digital tools, but rather that they can enhance the tools themselves. In other words, if we have this additional information that accounts for the fallibility of the human mind, in designing these tools it will only lead to tools that are more user friendly. As a whole, this event, particularly as my first Digital Humanities, not only brought up a lot of intriguing ideas in a brief and exciting way, but also worked to enforce the idea that the Digital World in Canada is only just beginning; as a result, validating my choice to explore the world of Digital Humanities and demonstrating the practicality of adding the Digital Humanities stream to my degree.
