### Canada in the Digital World: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly


On November 2nd, I attended Policy Ignite’s event Canada in the Digital World: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. At first, heading to the event, I began to ponder ‘how will this event help me?’ or ‘how will this event be applicable to someone not working in the government?’, and the answers to my questions become increasingly clear as the night progressed; this event solidified exactly how imbedded digital tools are in our society, and more importantly, how the need for digital tools and advancements are only growing. While the main theme of the program revolved around the way that digital tools need to continue to find their way into government to enhance society and efficiency, I began to feel more at ease when I heard words like Github, or Slack, which I now know what they are and, debatably, how they work. Some of the talks covered topics such as Geomapping, creating space within government to share code and tools, how using digital tools could enhance efficiency, and the most applicable to our studies in Digital Humanities, is the need to incorporate the human into the digital. This lecture, was for me, by far the most applicable to our purpose and in fact extremely interesting; it was conducted by a Behaviour Neurologist. She tackled the downsides of the digital in terms of the downsides of the human brain and argued that these downsides are not to be seen as reducing the benefits of digital tools, but rather that they can enhance the tools themselves. In other words, if we have this additional information that accounts for the fallibility of the human mind, in designing these tools it will only lead to tools that are more user friendly. As a whole, this event, particularly as my first Digital Humanities, not only brought up a lot of intriguing ideas in a brief and exciting way, but also worked to enforce the idea that the Digital World in Canada is only just beginning; as a result, validating my choice to explore the world of Digital Humanities and demonstrating the practicality of adding the Digital Humanities stream to my degree.

### Digital Interfaces: A Significant Contribution to Early Modern Theatre Studies,  Christophe Schuwey 




During the lecture by Christophe Schuwey at the Carleton University Gordon Wood Lounge, Schuwey explored the ways in which digital interfaces can change the way we experience early modern theatre and literature. At the crux of his presentation, Schuwey highlights how the interface, more than the mere appearance of the tool, can change both the work and viewer experience. For instance, he demonstrated how building a user-friendly and up to date interface can be organized to promote a specific research pathway--the tool can guide the researcher to specific conclusions. Moreover, the tool has the ability to transform and reimagine literature the way it was intended, but for a modern audience Here, Schuwey showed an interface that presented a text as text messages--allowing modern readers to grasp the complexity and banter of the text. In terms of theatre, another interesting interface he produced was one which included historical information regarding theatre tickets sold and created a visualization demonstrating the volume of people attending a production on a given date--this visualization was informed by ticket sales as well as reported weather conditions.These multitude of projects demonstrated Schuwey's main claim, that the interface is more than appearance but is at the crux of any project--both in terms of its productivity and accessibility.

### Make Some Noise! Hands-on Electronic: Music at the Creator Space 

           
           
           
           
           
This event at Ottawa University explored many ways in which digital tools can enhance the experience of music. At the lecture, tools could be paired with instruments to record and combine sound in new ways. Here, the musician could combine the sound of multiple instruments and play those sounds using only one instrument. This lecture demonstrated the way that these tools (open to the public during scheduled hours) can open up both digital tools and music. Here, people (particularly students) can use one instrument rather than needing to spend thousands on multiple instruments. In addition, the tools that could be combined with the instruments open up accessibility as those tools and instruments are available at the university.

### Getting Your Work Out There: Publishing in the Open avec / with Jeanette Hatherill & Sarah Simpkin

        
        
        
        
This event, part of the larger series of Digital Humanity events at Ottawa University explored what it means to publish in the open. At the core of the lecture was demonstrating to the audience a wide range of tools available to scholars looking to publish their work--these tools could inform them on the rules and restrictions of particular journals. Moreover, we explored the new ways that it is possible to publish in the open, that is to allow your work to be open to the public, such as with PressBooks. There are also tools like Sherpa/RoMEO that is a database of self-archiving policies for Copyright.

### Mapping the Holocaust with ArcGIS with Miranda Brethour & Fiona Davidson

        
        
        
       
Using ArcGIS, a tool used for digital mapping, this lecture part of the series at OttawaU. At the lecture, they showed us how ArcGIS can be used to provide a tool that could humanize the mapping of the Holocaust and ghettos. While other mapping efforts proved producitive in tracing the deaths in rural areas between 1943-45. As the researchers (Brethour and Davidson) suggested,these methods of mapping dehumanized the autrocities of the Holocaust, as the deaths were visualized as circles, rather than the lives lost.Therefore, the ArcGIS project enabled a way to both map the changes and deaths in communal areas through the use of images--such as images from within the Ghettos. Here, functioning as a semi-workshop, we learned how to both upload texts and images on to the map.
